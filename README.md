# VITMarksCalculator
As FATs are cancelled, check out how much you score in total in each course 

### About the project
As VIT cancelled the FATs (Final Assessment Test) for the Winter Semester (2019-2020) and going to award the final grades by internal marks, every student is calculating thier final scores. So, I decided to make a simple application to calculate the marks using python's GUI package Tkinter.



## Disclaimer
- All the calculations are made according to my understanding of the result processing procedures.
- Its just to predict our final score, for final grades wait until university release officially.
